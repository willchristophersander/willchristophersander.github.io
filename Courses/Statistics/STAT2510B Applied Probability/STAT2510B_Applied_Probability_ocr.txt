Stat 2510 Applied Probability Fall 2024

Richard Single, richard.single [at] uvm [dot] edu
Modality: Flipped with synchronous meetings on T/TH 10:05 - 11:20 in Votey 303.

Required Materials:
e Text: “Probability and Statistical Inference (9" or 10" edition)” by Robert V. Hogg & Elliot A. Tanis
e A scientific calculator (something other than your phone)

Prerequisites: Calculus II is required.
Software:
The software platforms MS Teams and Brightspace will be used as described in the “Required Software

Platforms” section below.

Please read this technology check list (https://www.uvm.edu/it/kb/student-technology-resources/) to make sure
you are ready for classes and contact the Helpline (802-656-2604) for support with technical issues.

Course description:

In order to model a real-world phenomenon in a realistic manner one must allow for the possibility of
randomness. That is, one must be able to account for events that may or may not occur (random events).
Probability provides the framework for describing and understanding random events. Statistics combines the art
of making sense out of data and the science of making decisions in the face of uncertainty due to randomness.

We will discuss a variety of theory and applications including topics in combinatorics, conditional probability,
random variables, mathematical expectation, limit theorems, and statistics.

The class will consist of recorded lectures (viewed prior to class), in-class group work, discussion, and projects
to highlight particular topics. It would be impossible, however, for these to encompass all of the material for the
course. There will be some material in the text for which you will be responsible that we will not have time to
cover in detail during class. J expect that you will be reading the material in the text.

The course will cover material from chapters 1-5 in the text and additional topics if time allows.

Topics Chapters
Properties of Probability (Conditional Probability, Independent Events, Bayes' Rule) 1
Discrete Distributions (Bernoulli, Binomial, and Poisson Distributions)

Continuous Distributions (Uniform, Exponential, Gamma, Chi-square, & Normal)

Bivariate Distributions (Conditional Distributions, Sums of Independent Random Variables)
Distributions of Functions of Random Variables

Assignments & Policies:

Watching and taking notes on the pre-recorded class videos will be an ongoing homework assignment
throughout the course. You will submit pre-class notes before each class meeting about the video assigned for
that day’s class. Weekly homework assignments are listed on the class webpage and will be due on Fridays by
midnight. Late assignments will not be accepted. Your lowest homework score will be dropped.

Be sure to preface the subject of any email related to the course with “STAT 2510”, otherwise I may not see
your email (e.g., STAT 2510: your subject here).

HW assignments will be submitted via Brightspace. Classwork will be submitted each meeting via MS Forms
(using the “tinyurl” for the course).


Stat 2510 Applied Probability Fall 2024

You are encouraged to work together in groups, and you will be doing so during the synchronous class meeting
time. Solutions to classwork and homework assignments must be written on your own. This will help to clarify
your understanding of the material by ensuring that you have thought through the ideas for yourself. You must
note the name(s) of any group partners on the top of any assignment that is a group effort. The best way to learn
ideas in Probability is to do examples, so I encourage you to do as many problems as you can (in addition to
those that you turn in!).

Each assignment that you turn in must have the following header information included on the first page:
FirstName LastName
Stat 2510
Homework #
You must show your work for each problem, since no credit will be given for simply writing the final answer.
Your grade will be reduced if the work is messy or difficult to read.

Grading:

Your final grade will be determined by your exams, quizzes, homework, and participation in class discussions
according to the distribution below. Quizzes will begin weekly but may move to bi-weekly as the semester
unfolds. Attendance will be taken at each class and will count toward your participation grade.

Quizzes 10%

PCN* & Participation 13% | *PCN=Pre-Class Notes

HW & Projects 12%

2 Exams 40% (planned for 9/26 and 11/5)

Final 20% (09-DEC-2024, 10:30-13:15, VOTEY 303)

Letter grades will be assigned using standard thresholds - a numerical score of 88% will translate into at least an
A-, 78% will translate into at least a B-, 68% will translate into at least a C-, ...

Recording of Class Sessions
If there is a need to have any remote class sessions, they will be recorded for you to refer back to. Students who

participate with their camera engaged or utilize a profile image are agreeing to have their video or image
recorded. If you are unwilling to consent to have your profile or video image recorded, be sure to keep your
camera off and do not use a profile image. Likewise, students who un-mute during class are agreeing to have
their voices recorded. If you are not willing to consent to have your voice recorded during class, you will need
to keep your mute button activated and communicate exclusively using the "chat" feature, which allows students
to type questions and comments live.

OTHER REQUIRED SOFTWARE PLATFORMS

MS Teams
MS Teams will be used for synchronous meetings and for office hours. Please follow this link for instructions to
download MS Teams. When you login, you should be able to see the MS Team for our specific course.

Brightspace
I will use Brightspace to post HW solutions and collect HW assignments. I do not plan to post messages or

announcements via Brightspace.

Calculator (not an app on your phone)

You will need to bring a scientific calculator to class that has memory storage. We will be using it for classwork
in almost every class. You cannot use your phone for computation during classwork or for exams. The only time
you will be using your phone during class is to scan and submit daily classwork.

If I see you using your phone during class (other than for submitting classwork), I will ask you to put it away the
first time. I will ask you to leave the second time. It is a distraction for you and those sitting near you.

STUDENT LEARNING ACCOMMODATIONS

In keeping with University policy, any student with a documented disability interested in utilizing
accommodations should contact SAS, the office of Student Accessibility Services on campus. SAS works with
students and faculty in an interactive process to explore reasonable and appropriate accommodations, which are
communicated to faculty in an accommodation letter. All students are strongly encouraged to meet with their
faculty to discuss the accommodations they plan to use in each course. A student’s accommodation letter lists
those accommodations that will not be implemented until the student meets with their faculty to create a plan.

STATEMENT ON ALCOHOL AND CANNABIS IN THE ACADEMIC ENVIRONMENT.
As a faculty member, I want you to get the most you can out of this course. You play a crucial role in your
education and in your readiness to learn and fully engage with the course material. It is important to note that
alcohol and cannabis have no place in an academic environment. They can seriously impair your ability to learn
and retain information not only in the moment you may be using, but up to 48 hours or more afterwards. In
addition, alcohol and cannabis can:

e Cause issues with attention, memory and concentration

e Negatively impact the quality of how information is processed and ultimately stored

e Affect sleep patterns, which interferes with long-term memory formation

course.
