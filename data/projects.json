In parallel, I am developing central-vacuum integration for the base dustbin using 3D printed interfaces, automated gates, and a custom Dreame-compatible dustbin design. The goal is to replace failure-prone cheap pump kits with a system that better handles gray water and automatically performs periodic clean-water flushing to maintain pump health. The current system works, and I am actively rewriting parts of the working Python control code into C for better efficiency while continuing safety and reliability iteration. The system also automatically refills clean water for both the robot and base. Because the X30 Ultra base automatically doses detergent, the mopping workflow is largely hands-off aside from refilling detergent every few months and occasional baseboard cleaning.",

The project used PyBullet to build a simulation-based evolutionary robotics workflow and combined weekly deliverables into a full experiment system involving neural-network and robotics components. As summarized by the course: Over the final four weeks of the semester, each student used their software system to perform an evolutionary robotics experiment, submitted weekly deliverables, handed in a written report, and gave an oral presentation during the exam period.",
